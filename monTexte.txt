The Opéra Bastille (French About this sound  (help·info)) (Bastille Opera House) is a modern opera house in Paris, France. Inaugurated in 1989 as part of President François Mitterrand’s “Grands Travaux”, it became the main facility of the Paris National Opera, France's principal opera company, alongside the older Palais Garnier; most opera performances are shown at the Bastille along with some ballet performances and symphony concerts, while "Garnier" presents a mix of opera and ballet performances.

Designed by Uruguayan architect Carlos Ott, it is located at the Place de la Bastille, in the 12th arrondissement; it seats 3,309 people in total, with a main theatre, concert hall and studio theatre.
